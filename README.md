# VBS-Obfuscator-Go
VBS-Obfuscator-GO is a Go-based tool designed for obfuscating VBScript (VBS) files. It transforms readable VBScript code into a less recognizable form by employing random variable names and encoding character values using mathematical operations. This helps protect scripts from casual inspection and modification.
